#### **Introduction**<br />
I just finished watching _Wind Breaker_, and it’s more than just a _brawl-filled anime_, it carries powerful _**principles**_ worth living by.

Especially when it comes to what it truly means to be the top dog. _**A leader.**_

#### **Leading..**<br />
Being a leader comes with _**responsibility**_ and _**accountability**_.

When you're chosen to lead a team, you carry the _**weight of decisions**_, direction, and organization. 

Well, during my second year, first semester, it was one of the _**smoothest and most fulfilling leadership**_ experiences I’ve had.

#### **It's Not About the Title...**<br />
That semester was _seamless_. No major conflicts, no overwhelming hardships. 

Everything was well-organized: schedules were set, deadlines were met, and teamwork was effortless.

I led my group in logic and design for computer circuits. We completed our documents, set up our hardware, and met every deadline without stress. Even in other subjects, everything was smooth and structured.

Looking back, I realized that leadership _isn’t about the title_. It's about the _responsibility_ that comes with it. 

I didn’t fixate on being "the leader." Instead, I asked myself: _**What can I do now that I’ve been given this role?**_

That realization shaped my perspective: it’s not about chasing a title; _**it’s about what you can do once you’re placed in that position.**_

Anyone can be called a _leader_, but can they _truly lead?_ Can they take _action_ and make a _difference?_

I never thought leadership would be something I’d enjoy so much…

#### **Conclusion..**<br />
Success doesn’t come easy. 

Fulfillment requires effort. 

But in the end, it’s not about the title, it’s about what you do when given the role.

And just like in life, when you’re put in a challenging position… ask yourself: _**What can I do about it?**_
