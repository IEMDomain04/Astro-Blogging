#### **Introduction**<br />
Leading a group is enjoyable.. But sometimes you need to come up with a _**critical decision..**_

#### **Applying for the Role**<br />
In 2023, I joined the UI/UX volunteering team at GDSC PLM. Later, I also became involved in design and branding.

That’s where I met our UI/UX Lead—someone hardworking, approachable, and deeply dedicated to her role. She set the bar for leadership.

Fast forward to the end of the 2023–2024 GDSC chapter. They were looking for new executives.

One evening, I received a long, thoughtful message from my UI/UX Lead. She asked me if I would _**consider applying for the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) role**_ at GDSC PLM.

Her message was so encouraging that saying “no” didn’t even cross my mind.

So, I told her: I can manage.

#### **The Application Process**<br />
After that conversation, I applied for the CTO role.

Then came the interview.

One of the key questions was: _**“How would you handle a team that isn’t active?”**_

I kept my response simple: _**I would initiate.**_

Because once someone takes the first step, the rest will follow.. 

Well, not instantly, but eventually.

I simply answered their questions, stayed true to myself, and let the process unfold.

Then, the results came in.

I hadn’t set any expectations, but when I received the email result…

I was officially selected as the new CTO of GDSC PLM.

Oddly enough, I didn’t feel excitement. Instead, my mind was clouded with uncertainty.

#### **The Power of Referrals**<br />
Sometime later, I came across a post on Facebook:

And it reminded me of something my former UI/UX Lead had said to me:

_**“Emman, we're looking for someone we can trust for this role, and I believe you're the right fit.”**_

That moment hit me hard. I realized that my selection wasn’t just about my skills, it was also about trust. My Lead had faith in me, and that meant everything.

Referrals hold immense weight when applying for a role. 

Having someone acknowledge your abilities, vouch for you, and place their trust in you is both humbling and motivating.

But that trust also comes with a responsibility—to prove myself worthy of it.

#### **Playing It Safe**<br />
After getting accepted as CTO, my mind spiraled with questions.

Was I ready for this? Did I move up too fast? Could I handle it?

I overthought every possibility.

And in the end… I stepped down.

I messaged my UI/UX Lead, the former CTO, and even the new CEO, explaining my decision.

Do I regret it? Yes and no.

I felt like I was skipping steps—from volunteer to CTO in one leap. I wanted to take things gradually, to progress at a steady pace rather than rush into a position I wasn’t sure I was ready for.

#### **Reflections**<br />
Was stepping down the right choice?

Everyone respected my decision, but deep down, something felt off. Was I moving too fast… or was I just afraid?

I don’t know. And honestly, I don’t like thinking about it too much.

But one thing is certain: that was one of my DOTGA (Defining Of The Greatest All-time) moments in 2024.

#### **Conclusion**<br />
Life is full of decisions, and sometimes, we need to pause and reflect before making them. But if an opportunity comes, even if it feels overwhelming—take it. Treat it as a challenge and figure things out along the way.

As a person, a student, and a leader, I’ve learned that growth comes from adaptability.

If you’re scared—do it scared.If you’re tired—rest, then try again.

Promise yourself this: When a door swings open, step inside—no hesitation.

And if you're unsure of what comes next?

Trust yourself—you’ll figure it out..
