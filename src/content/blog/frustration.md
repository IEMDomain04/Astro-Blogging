_**It's so frustrating..**_

#### **Introduction**<br />
Have you ever felt the urge to help someone? Desperate to step in? Only to realize… you **can’t?** Even helping yourself.. **you can't..**

Imagine these..

**_You stare at an exam paper, the questions blurring together and you have no answers._**

**_Someone turns to you for help, desperate for answers, but you have none to give._**

**_You want to create a project, but just can't do it because you don't know what to do.._**

**_Someone is critically ill, struggling to hold on and you can’t do anything._**

**_You watch a loved one suffer from an illness and you’re powerless to ease their pain._**

**_What if they collapsed right in front of you? Would you be able to carry them? To help them?_**

The weight of _**helplessness is crushing.**_

Just by writing this part of the blog, it **triggers** my urge to improve and do something now..

But first, let me finish writing this. Because every step, even this one, is part of the process.

That **feeling..** Watching a situation just happened, knowing you’re **powerless, weak, and don't know anything** to change it.. 

It settles in like a **heavy stone** in your chest.

It’s frustrating when that **thought alone haunts you.**

It’s unbearable when you witness it firsthand.

What if you experienced it yourself?

Then it’s a kind of frustration that **words can’t contain.**

#### **Snapped it out**<br />
It’s unbearable to be placed in a situation like that.

Then, a realization snapped—

_**I need to do something.**_

_**Something has to change.**_

The frustration makes me want to **rush** the process, to **force** an **immediate** result.

But here’s the truth: _**growth isn’t instant.**_

_**I need to breathe.**_ To trust the process. To improve, stronger, smarter, one step at a time.

As human beings, **we are dynamic.** We grow, adapt, and change. That’s our power.

Yet, we often define ourselves by numbers.. Test scores, rankings, achievements.. forgetting that numbers are absolute while we are limitless.

A number is fixed. It cannot evolve, improve, or push beyond its value.

But you can.

Your abilities, your potential, and what you’re truly capable of **can’t be measured** by a simple number.

#### **Be Better**<br />
Hello there! The one reading this.

It’s __never too late__ to grow, to improve, to change your path in life.

After all…

_**The best time to change was yesterday.**_

_**The second best time is now.**_

You can’t __rewrite__ the past, it’s just a chapter that’s already been read.

But you can start a new story today.

And when you finish reading this, know this.. I’m already a **changed person**, stepping into a **new phase of life…** with the same name. _(IDK if you know me well.. but yeah..)_

Thank you for your time.

_**Be better..**_
