#### **Introduction**<br>
Do you ever feel **unsatisfied** with your output?

Like it could be better than what has already been done?

But in reality, it’s already decent and good enough as a proper output.

You can just improve it over time and make progress.

#### **A Time Pressure Deadline**<br>
Well, my professor taught us about the Monte Carlo Simulation...

It’s a simulation that runs endlessly with various variables.

It’s a fascinating topic to appreciate.

He gave us an activity: form a group and program a simulation for it in a COLOR GAME.

At first, I was calm since I could deliver it quickly.

But the thing is...

I wanted it to be **perfect**.

#### **Double Check, Triple Check**<br>
It got to the point where, after finishing the system—including user validations and responsiveness<br> 
**_(this is my standard when developing a website or web app)_**

I still felt like something was wrong with the web app.

I felt like **something was missing.**

_(Well, the responsiveness needed work since my groupmate generated it with ChatGPT, but the system worked fine with user validations.)_

But in **reality, there wasn’t.**

#### **Be Kind and Appreciate Yourself More**<br>
I sent it to my classmates, and one of them even used the web app my group created.

>Classmate 1 told me he wanted the money he won!<br>
>**_Which means he played the app and took it seriously... yeyyy._**

>Classmate 2 praised the UI and validation of our Monte Carlo Game.<br>
>**_He mentioned that it was decent and fun to play, with complete user validation as well. Very nice._**

After reflecting on all this, I realized I need to **relax and appreciate myself** more when creating systems.

Just like my Elective Professor once said:<br>
**_There is no perfect system; it’s always 95%. Where is the other 5%? It’s in fixing and improving the system once deployed and utilized._**

#### **Conclusion**<br>
When delivering an output, **appreciate the process**.

Everything is decent, everything is good. **There’s nothing wrong**.

Be kind to yourself. It’s not bad to have high standards, but it’s unhealthy to stress and exhaust yourself with unrealistic over-standards.

Relax and deliver.

Deploy it, and make it better next time.

**Nothing is perfect at first.**

It **takes time.**
