#### **Introduction**<br>
Do you ever feel **_unsatisfied_** with your performance or output?

Like it could have been better than what you've already done?

Yeah, I know that feeling..

But in reality, your performance is **already good enough.**

You're just being **too hard** on yourself. Hahaha.

_Coming from someone who's already hard on himself—now writing this blog to ease up a little._

Now, let me walk you through why I chose this title for my story.

#### **A Time Pressure Deadline**<br>
It all started at 3PM, my professor taught us about the Monte Carlo Simulation...

It’s a simulation that simulated endlessly with various variables.

It’s a fascinating topic to appreciate knowing that it can measure a possibility with just simulating over and over again.

After discussion, he gave us an activity: Create a program that simulates a Monte Carlo Simulation using color game.

At first, I was calm since I could deliver it quickly.

But suddenly, a thought started bugging me...

**_How can I make this perfect?_**

#### **Double Check, Triple Check**<br>
Few hours passed.. I managed to finish the systems backend logic..

It got to the point where, after finishing the system—including user validations and responsiveness. 
**_(this is my standard when developing a website or web app)_**

I still felt like something was wrong with the web app.

I felt like **_something was missing._**

_(Well, the responsiveness needed work since my groupmate generated it with ChatGPT, but the system worked fine with user validations.)_

A large wave of thoughts started to flood my mind.. 

_**WAS there a missing piece to my system??**_

After getting frustrated, I took a drink and paused to reflect.

Slowly, my thoughts began to come together, and I started to feel more relaxed.

I asked myself.. **_"Is something missing in the system?"_**

But in reality, **_there isn't._**

#### **Already Good Enough**<br>
I sent it to my classmates, and one of them even used the web app my group created.

>Classmate 1 told me he wanted the money he won!<br>
>**_Which means he played the app and took it seriously... yeyyy._**

>Classmate 2 praised the UI and validation of our Monte Carlo Game.<br>
>**_He mentioned that it was decent and fun to play, with complete user validation as well. Very nice._**

After reflecting on all this, I realized I need to **relax and appreciate myself** more when creating systems.

Just like my Elective Professor once said:<br>
**_There is no perfect system; it’s always 95%. Where is the other 5%? It’s in fixing and improving the system once deployed and utilized._**

#### **Conclusion**<br>
When delivering an output, **appreciate the process**.

Everything is decent, everything is good. **There’s nothing wrong**.

Be kind to yourself. It’s not bad to have high standards, but it’s unhealthy to stress and exhaust yourself with unrealistic over-standards.

Relax and deliver.

Deploy it, and make it better next time.

**Nothing is perfect at first.**

Remember, you can always improve over time and keep making progress.
