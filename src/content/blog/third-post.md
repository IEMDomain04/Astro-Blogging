#### **Introduction**

I wasn’t always a top student. In fact, back in elementary, my grades barely made it past 75. Scoring an 80? That wasn’t a big deal for me—I was used to it.

Let’s be real. No one starts out as an expert. Learning is a journey, and we all begin somewhere.

As I moved through school, I found myself placed in the higher sections. Eventually, I secured a spot in Section 1 throughout high school—the so-called “cream of the crop.”

Even during my high school years and the chaotic days of the pandemic, I noticed something: students were obsessed with grades. So much so that scoring below 90 would send some into an emotional spiral.

#### **College Will Humble You**

Fast forward to college—I got into PLM to study Computer Science. My goal? To learn. Sure, grades mattered, but they weren’t my priority.

If there’s one thing college does well, it’s humbling you.

You’ll encounter subjects that make you question your abilities. You’ll struggle with concepts that seem impossible to grasp. It’s frustrating, yes, but it’s also necessary.

Because at the end of the day, whether as a student or just as a person—you still have a lot to learn.

Progress takes effort. Struggling through difficult topics teaches you the value of hard work. And that? That’s far more valuable than having everything come easily.

#### **Imposters**

Now, let’s talk about grades again.

In college, they publish grade rankings—a list of names ordered by academic performance. And let me tell you, I’ve seen a lot of imposters.

I’m not talking about Imposter Syndrome. I mean people who appear to be top students but, in reality, aren’t as skilled as their grades suggest.

You might see someone with high marks and assume they’re brilliant. But behind the scenes? They rely on AI tools like ChatGPT to do their assignments and answer their quizzes. (No offense, just facts.)

It feels fake.

That’s why, for me, skills matter more than grades.

Even some professors agree:

“Not all honor students deserve their titles. Some of them got their grades easily, without really learning anything.”

#### **Sharing Achievements**

This year, as a third-year student, I found my name on the front page of that grade ranking. I earned my high scores through effort and actual learning.

But then, Imposter Syndrome kicked in.

I’ve always been the type to keep things low-key. I believed that achievements should be noticed by others, not flaunted by the achiever.

Still, the urge to share was strong. So, I posted it.

#### **Changed POV**

I used to think: “Why do people even post their achievements? Is it really necessary?”

Then a friend told me something that shifted my perspective:

“There’s nothing wrong with it, man. As long as you’re not stepping on anyone, it’s fine.”

That made me realize—sharing achievements isn’t about bragging. It’s about being proud of what you worked for.

So, I decided: I won’t hold myself back anymore. I’ll celebrate my efforts, not hide them.

#### **Learn First, Then Grades Will Follow**

I didn’t just earn high grades—I truly learned.

A high school friend reached out.

_**"Nice!"**_ he said. A simple word, but I could tell he meant, it felt good to have my efforts recognized.

I replied, _**"Mas maganda kung may combination ng learnings.."**_

He said:

>_"Cap."_

>"_Well, in your case, I’m sure there’s learning…_"

>"_Sobra-sobra pa._"

I humbly answered, _**"Aral tayo nang mabuti."**_

Because, really, how can you expect high grades if you don’t study or put in the effort?

Are you some kind of genius who just magically understands everything?

That’s why I hold on to this belief:

_**“Study to understand and learn. The grades will follow.”**_

When you truly learn, exams become easier. Projects and activities feel manageable. And the grades? They come naturally.

#### **Conclusion**

Don’t get me wrong, I know grades are important. They validate a student’s performance in school.

But at the core of education is learning, understanding concepts, applying knowledge, and growing as a thinker.

Because in the real world, no one will ask about your GPA.

They’ll ask: _**What can you do?**_
