                Welcome! 
                <br /><br />
                This is my time writing a blog, so please bear with me as my interest in writing blogs started to kick in.
                I want to be good at writing stories and blogs, not just in tech.
            </p>
            <p>
                I guess the ability to write stories and blog could help improve my delivery skills when it comes to presenting. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, I want to practice Astro Framework, so might as well utilize this astro framework for my blog..
